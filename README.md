# Night Adder

Night Adder is a multithreaded, lock-free physics engine that makes use of
Velan Studio's [Viper Engine](https://github.com/VelanStudios/viper-engine).
Currently tested and developed on Linux. Linux support for the Viper Engine is available
through the [linux-support branch](https://github.com/wphicks/viper-engine/tree/linux-support)
of William Hicks' fork of Viper.
